# EgoCS Race Car Example
This is a simple and interactive Unity3d example project to show how to use EgoCs (Entity Component System).
EgoCS is an Entity Component System (ECS) Framework specifically made for C# and Unity

Get EgoCS here: https://github.com/andoowhy/EgoCS

This example aims to demonstrate :

1. Create Components, attach them to Entities (GameObjects)

2. Create Events (to get the systems to communicate)

3. Create Systems (to do all the logic of the game)
